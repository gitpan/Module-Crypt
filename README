--------
Abstract
--------

Module::Crypt encrypts your pure-Perl modules and then compiles them
into a XS module. This lets you distribute binary versions without
disclosing code.

------------
Requirements
------------

Module::Crypt requires Module::Build as a backend.

------------------
Basic Installation
------------------

Module::Crypt may be installed through the CPAN shell in
the usual manner.  Typically:

  $ perl -MCPAN -e 'intstall Module::Crypt'

You can also read this README from the CPAN shell:

  $ perl -MCPAN -e shell
  cpan> readme Module::Crypt

And you can install the component from the CPAN prompt as well:

  cpan> install Module::Crypt

-------------------
Manual Installation
-------------------

This module may also be installed manually.  Its distribution is
available from the author's CPAN directory,
<ftp://ftp.cpan.org/pub/CPAN/authors/id/A/AA/AAR/>, or a similarly
named directory at your favorite CPAN mirror.

Downloading and unpacking the distribution are left as exercises for
the reader.  To build and test it:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make test

When you're ready to install the component:

  make install

It should now be ready to use.

Thanks for reading!
