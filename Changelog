version 0.06 (2011/01/22):

    - Refactored Perl code a little; got rid of Crypt.xs
    - RC4 encryption is now dependent on Crypt::RC4
    - Rewrote data generation code in Perl
    - Added random padding before password, after password and after
      module text; the whole data block is rounded up to 512 bytes
    - Added ability to use arbitrary password
    - Added password XORing in resulting shared object
    - Added debugger check; if it's on and we're running under debugger,
      XS code will die the flaming death
    - Added option to run arbitrary Perl code *before* main module code
      gets unencrypted. Additional code is also encrypted with RC4.
